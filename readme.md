# Monster Hunter Wilds SDK
Welcome to the Monster Hunter Wilds SDK!

This SDK consumes an [API](https://docs.wilds.mhdb.io/) to retreive Monster Hunter Wilds data.

### Examples
```
// TODO
```

### TODO
- Rethink models, maybe I shouldn't map the data as directly as I currently am
- Write the rest of the models (Weapons)
- Custom json mapping for things like monster resistances & weaknesses? (Discriminant)
- query parameter
- phpunit tests
